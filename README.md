#VIRTUAL PIANO PROJECT

![header-piano](/img/header-piano.jpg)


Hello, Matteo here, a "The Odin Project" student. For this particular task
we were asked to code along with a YouTube guy to practice JS by making 
a basic drum kit.

- link to the The Odin Project lesson [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events#method-3)

I wanted to take a few steps further and make this my first "Big Project".
As a Piano Player myself, instead of the drum kit, my idea is to build a Virtual Piano :musical_keyboard:, so for this task
I kinda followed a different route and deliberately made things more difficult
for me. Hopefully it goes well.


I looked at the video twice to grasp what I could.

**The rule for this project is to never get back to that video again, but try to recall everything.**
**If I am stuck, then I have to Google it**
